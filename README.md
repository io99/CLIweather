# CLIweather

Command Line based weather showing tool created with the help of following API's
1) IPINFO to detect the user's location.
2) Darksky.net's weather API. I could've used Openweather.org but didn't since lot of things have changed after they added subscription.
--------------
other than these I've used Yargs for the command line interface
